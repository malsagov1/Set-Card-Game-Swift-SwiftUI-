# Set-Card-Game-Swift-SwiftUI-
This is a puzzle game, one of my first iOS apps with MVVM design developed back in 2021 as one of the initial assignments in Stanford CS193p iOS App Development course.

Set is a card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974. The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, square, circle), shading (solid, semitransparent, not filled), and color (red, yellow, or purple). Each possible combination of features (e.g. a card with three striped green diamonds) appears as a card precisely once in the deck.  In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a "set". For each one of the four categories of features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as either a) all the same, or b) all different. Put another way: For each feature the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different version.  For example, 3 solid red diamonds, 2 solid green squares, and 1 solid purple circle form a set, because the shadings of the three cards are all the same, while the numbers, the colors, and the shapes among the three cards are all different. The game is won if no cards left in deck, and all cards have set
