# Set-Card-Game-Swift-SwiftUI-
This is a puzzle game, one of my first iOS apps developed back in 2021 as one of the initial assignments in Stanford CS193p iOS App Development course.
Set is a card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974. The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, square, circle), shading (solid, semitransparent), and color (red, green, or purple). Each possible combination of features (e.g. a card with three striped green diamonds) appears as a card precisely once in the deck.  In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a "set". For each one of the four categories of features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as either a) all the same, or b) all different. Put another way: For each feature the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different version.  For example, 3 solid red diamonds, 2 solid green squares, and 1 solid purple circle form a set, because the shadings of the three cards are all the same, while the numbers, the colors, and the shapes among the three cards are all different.
